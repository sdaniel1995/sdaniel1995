I am a full-stack Java software developer with experience in building full-stack web applications. I went to school at Florida Polytechnic University where I received a Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Engineering. I have a heavy background in programming with ranging knowledge of multiple languages such as python, java, c++, and more. I really enjoy programming and the critical thinking that is involved. In the future, my goal is to continue learning new technology and mastering my skills to become a senior developer.

During my time at Revature, I’ve worked on several projects where I gained experience in both backend technologies (including Java, SQL, Spring framework, and microservice architecture) as well as frontend development (including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and React). I also have experience with DevOps and using CI/CD pipelines, deploying to the AWS cloud. I really enjoy collaborative team environments where I can learn from others, and I have worked hard to improve my interpersonal and communication skills. I look forward to applying all of my skills and prior experience in a position on your team.
